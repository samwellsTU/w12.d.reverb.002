    <h1>Web Audio: Reverb with <code>ConvolverNode</code></h1>
    <button id="start">Mic On</button>
    <button id="stop">Mic Off</button>
    <p>
        The <code>ConvolverNode</code> in the Web Audio API applies a linear convolution effect to audio. This is often used to simulate reverberation based on an <strong>impulse response</strong> (IR), which captures the acoustic signature of a physical space.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Linear Convolution?</h2>
    <p>
        Linear convolution is a process that combines two signals—typically an input signal and an impulse response—to produce a new signal. In audio, this means shaping an input sound based on how it would behave in a real-world environment (like a concert hall or chapel).
    </p>

    <h2>Loading an Impulse Response</h2>
    <p>
        To use a <code>ConvolverNode</code>, you need to load an audio file that contains the impulse response and decode it into an <code>AudioBuffer</code>. This buffer is then assigned to the <code>buffer</code> property of the convolver. Here's how that works:
    </p>

    <h2>Reverb with a Convolver Node</h2>
    <pre><code>const createReverb = async function() {
    let convolver = audioContext.createConvolver();

    // Load impulse response
    let response = await fetch("ir/TPAC-chapel.wav");
    let arraybuffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
    convolver.buffer = await audioContext.decodeAudioData(arraybuffer);

    return convolver;
}

// Usage
reverb = await createReverb();
reverb.connect(outputGain);
</code></pre>

    <p>
        This example loads an impulse response from <code>TPAC-chapel.wav</code> and sets it as the buffer for a <code>ConvolverNode</code>. Once created, the reverb is connected to the audio graph through <code>outputGain</code>.
    </p>
